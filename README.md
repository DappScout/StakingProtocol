# ERC20 Staking Protocol 🔐

A secure ERC20 token staking protocol with dynamic reward calculation

## Overview 🔍

 Staking Protocol allows users to stake their ERC20 tokens and earn rewards over time. The protocol includes security measures like pausing capabilities, reentrancy protection, rate limiting, and owner-only administrative functions.

## Features 🧱

- **Staking & Unstaking**: Securely stake and unstake ERC20 tokens
- **Reward System**: Earn rewards at a rate of approximately 3% APY
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Owner can adjust reward rates to accommodate market conditions
- **Emergency Controls**: Contract can be paused by owner in case of emergencies
- **Security Measures**: Implements reentrancy guards, rate limiting, and other protections
- **Time-based Rewards**: Rewards calculated based on time staked using block timestamps

## Architecture🌃

The protocol consists of the following components:

- `StakingContract.sol`: Core staking logic with security features
- `TokenERC20.sol`: ERC20 token implementation for staking

### Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated using the formula:
```
rewards = stakedAmount * rewardRate * timeElapsed / BASIS_POINTS
```

Where:
- Current `rewardRate` is 1,000,000,000 (configurable by owner)
- `BASIS_POINTS` is 10^18
- `timeElapsed` is calculated using block timestamps (current timestamp - last calculation timestamp)
- This results in approximately 3% APY


### Security Considerations🔒

This protocol implements multiple security features:
- OpenZeppelin's Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, and Ownable patterns
- SafeERC20 for secure token transfers
- Minimum staking amount requirements (configurable at deployment)
- Rate limiting to prevent flash loan attacks (1 hour between operations)
- Reserve balance checks to ensure contract solvency
- Input validation for all user interactions
- Comprehensive event logging for all important operations
- Emergency pause functionality for contract owner

## Getting Started🚀

### Prerequisites

- Solidity 0.8.28
- Foundry (for testing and deployment)

### Libraries versions
Built with 5.0.1 version of OpenZeppelin's libraries

To install this version, you can run:
```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.0.1
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SimpleStakingProtocol.git
cd SimpleStakingProtocol
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
forge install
```

### Testing🧪✅

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
forge test
```


## Key Invariants🔐📏

The protocol maintains several critical invariants to ensure security and correctness:

- Total staked amount = Sum of all individual user stakes
- Contract token balance ≥ Total staked amount + minimum reserve percentage
- User staked amount ≤ User token balance
- Only owner can pause/unpause contract and modify reward rates
- All state changes emit corresponding events
- Minimum time between certain user actions to prevent flash loan attacks
